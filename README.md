SKRPROforBLV
Compiled Marlin 2.0 for an SKR Pro on my corexy (BLVMGN).
This repository includes files modified by me to get an skr pro (BTT) to work on my CoreXY (BLV MGN CUBE).
You need Marlin 2.0 for this to work

Some features in no particular order:
  300x300 heat bed;
  cr10 stock display;
  dual extruder;
  bilinear abl (5x5, bltouch);
  z steppers auto alignment;
  nozzle park;
  wipe area;
  load/unload filament.
  
  You are more than welcome to use it, however i take no responsabilities for any damage to you or your 3d Printer (ie bowden tube lenght for loading/unloading filament, head movement towards nozzle park area)
